## Session Tokens

This package requires a valid session token from ChatGPT, under the hood it is using an unofficial REST API. Normal
authentication options are not available.

To get a session token:

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/chat
2. Open dev tools (right click > inspect || Ctrl-shift-i || F12)
3. Open Application > Cookies
4. Copy the value of \_\_Secure-next-auth.session-token

Provide this value for `chatgpt-session-token` in the action's inputs.
